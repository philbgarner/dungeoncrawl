#Dungeon Crawl

Temporary title, a little demo written based on a tileset found on Opengameart.org.

The next step would be to add some UI elements, inventory system and encounters and combat.

Long term I am hoping to implement the tiles more like textures: greyscale with normal maps and texture maps so that the colour schemes can be customized and perhaps dynamic lighting could be implemented (extreme reach goal).

Map right now was made with tilex lua export, this could easily be made procedural.
